# Security Policy

## 

## Versions

Due to the nature of our project - being open source - we have decided to patch only the latest major release (currently v1.x) for security vulnerabilities.

## How to disclose

Please use [our website](https://flarum.org/contact/security) for security issues that affect our project. If you believe you have found a vulnerability, please disclose it via our website. You can also disclose security issues by mailing security@flarum.org.

## What we do

Any submitted security issue will be checked thoroughly by our development team. A fix for the issue and a transparent information on GitHub about the issue existing will be released. You can view any previously identified issues on our [GitHub Security Page](https://github.com/flarum/.github/security). New major versions of Flarum will also receive a security audit to verify our efforts on providing a secure application.
